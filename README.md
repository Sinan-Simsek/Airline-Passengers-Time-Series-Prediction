# Airline-Passengers-Time-Series-Prediction

Introduction: Welcome to the "Air Passenger Forecasting - A Time Series Analysis" Kaggle competition! In this competition, we will delve into the captivating world of time series analysis to tackle a common challenge in the field of aviation and transportation â€“ forecasting the number of passengers traveling by airplanes. Time series analysis is a powerful tool that enables us to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonality in sequential data. By leveraging historical information, we can make accurate predictions for the future, aiding airlines and airports in efficient resource allocation and planning.

Aim: The primary goal of this competition is to develop predictive models that can forecast the number of passengers traveling via airplanes based on historical data. Participants will explore various time series analysis techniques, apply statistical tests, and select appropriate models to achieve accurate predictions. This competition mirrors a real-world scenario where airlines need to make informed decisions to accommodate passenger demand effectively.

Dataset Attributes: The dataset includes two main attributes:

Month: This attribute represents the month and year values for the data points.
#Passengers: The number of passengers who traveled using airplanes during the specified month and year.
Notebook Contents: To guide participants through this competition, we have structured the notebook into the following sections:

Dataset Information: An overview of the dataset, its structure, and initial exploration.
Time Series Analysis: A deep dive into time series concepts, including trend, seasonality, and stationarity. Participants will learn about statistical tests for time series analysis.
Modeling: Exploration of various modeling techniques with a focus on ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) models. Participants will learn how to select optimal model orders.
Conclusion: Summing up the insights gained from the analysis and showcasing the predictive power of the developed models.
